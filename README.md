   cd saransh-ai
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

## üí° How It Works

Saransh AI uses a sophisticated extractive summarization approach based on the TextRank algorithm:

1. **Content Extraction**: Uses Newspaper3k with BeautifulSoup fallback to extract article content
2. **Intelligent Processing**: Analyzes sentence importance using TextRank (similar to Google's PageRank)
3. **Smart Selection**: Picks the most relevant ~15% of sentences while maintaining context
4. **Clean Formatting**: Organizes content into readable paragraphs with proper spacing

## üéØ Use Cases
